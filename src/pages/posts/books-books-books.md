title: The never-ending reading list
excerpt: >-
  Over the few years, I've taken to collecting print and e-books. I probably have over 500 books I haven't read that at one point I thought to myself hey that could be useful. Going through my collections I am positive I may have some duplicates and I keep adding more, I believe that we never stop learning and trying to better ourselves. In today's remote world, I have found it personally more difficult to grow myself from my peers, and so I have returned to book studies. These are the current books on my desk in various states of completion.

### Let's be realistic
