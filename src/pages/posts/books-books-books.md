  Over the few years, I've taken to collecting print and e-books. I probably have over 500 books I haven't read that at one point I thought to myself hey that could be useful. Going through my collections I am positive I may have some duplicates and I keep adding more, I believe that we never stop learning and trying to better ourselves. In today's remote world, I have found it personally more difficult to grow myself from my peers, and so I have returned to book studies. These are the current books on my desk in various states of completion.

In the last few years, I have taken to collecting books and e-books. If I had to guess, I would say I probably have over 500 books that I haven't read. At one point, I thought to myself, hey, that could be useful; I should get a copy of that for a rainy day. Well, as you can imagine, that rainy day never seems to come. As I went through my collection, I  found multiples of some books and even books with multiple revisions. I keep adding more. I believe that we as people should never stop learning and strive to better ourselves daily. However, in today's remote world, I have found it more difficult to continue to grow solely from my peers, so I have returned once again to my collection of books. 

Here are the books that I picked up in Quarter 2 of 2021. As of this writing, they were all sitting on my desk in various states of completion.

## Engineering Management

*   **The First 90 Days** - *Michael D. Watkins*, 278 pages
*   **An Elegant Puzzle** - *Will Larson*, 285 pages
*   **Master Your Next Move** - *Michael D. Watkins*, 205 pages
*   **The Managers Path** - *Camille Fournier*, 226 pages

Totaling 994 pages

## Engineering Development

*   **A Philosophy of Software Design** - *John Ousterhout*, 177 pages
*   **Cracking the Coding Interview** - *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*, 696 pages
*   **The Pragmatic Programmer** -  *David Thomas, Andrew Hunt*, 325 pages
*   **The Art of UNIX Programming** - *Eric S. Raymond*, 524 pages
*   **Implementing Effective Code Reviews** - *Giuliana Carullo*, 196 pages
*   **Programming Pearls** - *Jon Bentley*, 239 pages
*   **Staff Engineer** - *Will Larson*, 370 pages
*   **Just Enough Software Architecture** - *George Fairbanks*, 360 pages

Totaling 2,887 pages

## Carving out the time

I have been looking for a good system to allow me to have the time to read the books and understand the material presented in these books. Furthermore, I want an easy way to retrieve the lessons that I have learned.

### Let's be realistic

If we look at all the books above and add up the pages, it works out to 3,881 pages which, if we take a conservative estimate of 1 page every 1.5 minutes (~300 words a minute) that works out to about 97 hours of total reading time. Additionally, during the week, I have about 30 minutes before work, 45 minutes on my lunch break to read, and finally, on the weekends, I have roughly 3hrs total. If we add that up, all in all, that works out to about 12 hours. Given that I was hoping to have these all completed before the holiday weekend (approximately two and half weeks from writing this article), I am about 67 hours short with that realization. 

### A plan for the plan

Now that I know what I'm up against, and given Parkinson's Law which states that "*Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion*." I can use this shortened time frame to my advantage. Let's come up with a revised plan; here are some things that I will need to consider.

- For myself, I know that shorter, intensive studying is more effective than drawn-out studying.
- Most non-fiction books can be summarized by reading all the section titles, studying the diagrams, and each section's first and last paragraphs.
- There are approximately 17 days and 12 books.
- I can have longer study/reading sessions on the weekends.

So given those items, I'll need to adjust things a bit. First, I'll want to prioritize and group the books. I'll go ahead and group them as follows:

#### Grouping 1

*   **Implementing Effective Code Reviews** - *Giuliana Carullo*, 196 pages
*   **Programming Pearls** - *Jon Bentley*, 239 pages

#### Grouping 2

*   **A Philosophy of Software Design** - *John Ousterhout*, 177 pages
*   **The Pragmatic Programmer** -  *David Thomas, Andrew Hunt*, 325 pages
*   **Just Enough Software Architecture** - *George Fairbanks*, 360 pages

#### Grouping 3

*   **Staff Engineer** - *Will Larson*, 370 pages

#### Grouping 4

*   **The First 90 Days** - *Michael D. Watkins*, 278 pages
*   **Master Your Next Move** - *Michael D. Watkins*, 205 pages
*   **The Managers Path** - *Camille Fournier*, 226 pages
*   **An Elegant Puzzle** - *Will Larson*, 285 pages

#### Grouping 5

*   **The Art of UNIX Programming** - *Eric S. Raymond*, 524 pages
*   **Cracking the Coding Interview** - *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*, 696 pages

### The Plan

Now that they are sorted by topic and priority, and we have grouped them, let's plan. If I give myself a little extra time (30 minutes a day), I can break a book down into four sessions. The first session will start the night before; after dinner, I'll spend 15 - 20 minutes working through the table of contents, introduction, epilogs, and appendix's, breaking the book into 3 study sessions. The first study session will be before work, likely while I am waiting for the coffee to finish brewing, and since I have, I'll be slotting this time, for study I will also work in a quick, simple breakfast (they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day). The next session will be while I am on my lunch break. The last and final session will be right after work. In each of these sessions, there is the possibility of going over by a few minutes if needed. 

- Fifteen minutes before bed, Table of Contents, Introduction & Appendix split the content into three sessions.
- Thirty minutes before work, work through section 1.
- Thirty minutes during lunch, work through section 2.
- Thirty minutes after work, work through section 3.

Lastly, we will need to break apart the two really large books into two days for each book. 

All in all, this will work out to 14 days, two days under our budget, and using Parkinson's Law, we know that my time will expand, so let's plan on using that extra time on *Just Enough Software Architecture* and *Staff Engineer*.

#### The final plan

* #### Week 1

  *   **Day 1** - Planning: *Implementing Effective Code Reviews*
  *   **Day 2** - Session 1, 2, 3: *Implementing Effective Code Reviews*, Planning: *Programming Pearls*
  *   **Day 3** - Session 1, 2, 3: *Programming Pearls*, Planning: *A Philosophy of Software Design*
  *   **Day 4** - Session 1, 2, 3: *A Philosophy of Software Design*, Planning: *The Pragmatic Programmer*
  *   **Day 5** - Session 1, 2, 3: *The Pragmatic Programmer*, Planning: *Just Enough Software Architecture*
  *   **Day 6** - Session 1, 2, 3: *Just Enough Software Architecture*
  *   **Day 7** - Session 4, 5, 6: *Just Enough Software Architecture*, Planning: *Staff Engineer*

* #### Week 2

  *   **Day 8** - Session 1, 2, 3: *Staff Engineer*
  *   **Day 9** - Session 4, 5, 6: *Staff Engineer*, Planning: *The First 90 Days*
  *   **Day 10** - Session 1, 2, 3: *The First 90 Days*, Planning: *Master Your Next Move*
  *   **Day 11** - Session 1, 2, 3: *Master Your Next Move*, Planning: *The Managers Path*
  *   **Day 12** - Session 1, 2, 3: *The Managers Path*, Planning: *An Elegant Puzzle*
  *   **Day 13** - Session 1, 2, 3: *An Elegant Puzzle*, Planning: *The Art of UNIX Programming*
  *   **Day 14** - Session 1, 2, 3: *The Art of UNIX Programming*

* #### Week 3

  *   **Day 15** - Session 4, 5, 6: *The Art of UNIX Programming*, Planning: *Cracking the Coding Interview*
  *   **Day 16** - Session 1, 2, 3: *Cracking the Coding Interview*
  *   **Day 17** - Session 4, 5, 6: *Cracking the Coding Interview*

### Searchable notes and lessons learned

Lastly, I didn't want to forget about making my notes and lessons learned searchable. Since all of the above are physical books rather than e-books, there isn't a good way to make them searchable unless I take the time to write everything in markdown format. Still, since I am trying to cram in 12 books into 17 days, this is probably an impossibility, and the notes wouldn't be that useful. So instead, I plan on purchasing all of the books as e-books as well, so that way I can add them to my kindle library and use the computer to do the searching for me in the event, I want to find something. 

There are tools ([Readwise](https://readwise.io)) that claim they can link my [Kindle Reader](https:/read.amazon.com) notes and highlights over to [Notion](https://notion.so), so maybe I'll give one of those a try and see how it goes in a future round of study.
